# AIM
In this Project,We're going to predict the price range of each mobile in the dataser based on the mobile specifications as : Battery power, 3G enabled , wifi ,Bluetooth, Ram etc .

# Usage
- This kind of prediction will help companies to  estimate the price of mobiles of an mobile phone based on its specifications.
- Beside that it will help Consumers to verify that they are paying best price according to the specs of the mobile.
